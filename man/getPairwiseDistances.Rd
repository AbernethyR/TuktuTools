\title{Daily Distance Calculations}
\usage{
getPairwiseDistances(sf.list)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf.list}{list of simple feature tracks}
}
\value{
data frame with (among others) ID, nickname, distance, date
}
\description{
This function (rather quickly) computes pairwise distances between daily mean locations
of animals.
}
\examples{
data(caribou)

# subset on the two individuals which have monitoring the same year (Vixen and Comet, in 2007)
# and transform into Simple Feature object
b.subset <- caribou \%>\% plyr::mutate(yday = yday(Time)) \%>\% 
  arrange(ID, Time) \%>\% subset(Year == 2007) \%>\%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("Lon","Lat")) \%>\% st_set_crs(4326) \%>\%
  mutate(Lon = st_coordinates(.)[,1], Lat = st_coordinates(.)[,2])

b.list <- dlply(b.subset, "ID", st_as_sf) # create a list of the sf by individual

# estimate the pairwise distances
distance.df <- getPairwiseDistances(b.list)

# Figure of the distance between the two individuals over time
plot(distance/1000~Date, data = distance.df, type = "l", ylab = "Distance between individuals (km)",

# Figure of the distance between the two individuals with the moments they were less than 5km apart
